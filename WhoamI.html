  <p>Lily Pellaud (born 2000) is an emerging artist based in Zurich, Switzerland.
  Her artistic practice is centered around the conception of site-specific installations and text-based works, often incorporating video elements.
  Sprouting from personal observations, her works blend the boundaries of public and private.
  Since her graduation in 2023, she has been reflecting on her life as a young artist through her work,
  exploring themes of labor, creativity, and productivity with a touch of humor or poetry.
  Her vibrant, surreal aesthetic often takes inspiration from movies and collage-like styles, with frequent incorporation of herself into her work.</p>
