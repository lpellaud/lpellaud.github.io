  <p>Lily Pellaud (born 2000) is an emerging artist based in Zurich, Switzerland.
  <p>Her artistic practice is centered around the conception of site-specific installations</p> 
  <p>and text-based works, often incorporating video elements. Sprouting from personal</p>
  <p>observations, her works blend the boundaries of public and private. Since her graduation</p>
  <p>in 2023, she has been reflecting on her life as a young artist through her work,</p>
  <p>exploring themes of labor, creativity, and productivity with a touch of humor or poetry.</p>
  <p>Her vibrant, surreal aesthetic often takes inspiration from movies and collage-like</p>
  <p>styles, with frequent incorporation of herself into her work.</p>
