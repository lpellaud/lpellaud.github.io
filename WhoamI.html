  <p>Lily Pellaud (born 2000) is an emerging artist based in Zurich, Switzerland. 
    Her artistic practice is centered around the conception of site-specific installations 
    and text-based works, often incorporating video elements. Sprouting from personal 
    observations, her works blend the boundaries of public and private. Since her graduation 
    in 2023, she has been reflecting on her life as a young artist through her work, 
    exploring themes of labor, creativity, and productivity with a touch of humor or poetry. 
    Her vibrant, surreal aesthetic often takes inspiration from movies and collage-like 
    styles, with frequent incorporation of herself into her work.</p>
